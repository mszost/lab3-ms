        <h1> ASCII Webcam </h1>

        <h3> Team Members </h3>
        <p> I will be working alone. </p>

        <img src="example-img.jpg" alt="example image">

        <h3> Application Overview </h3>
        <p>
            Takes the users webcam view or an image specified by the user as its input 
            and displays an ASCII text "drawing". The final result should look similar 
            to the image on the right  â†’
        </br> 

            <div class="mono">
                This is an illusion created by the nature of monospace fonts.         
                Characters all take up the same amount of space regardless of pixel density.           
                Becuase of this, a very dense character like "@" can represent a white "pixel" of
                the image and "." or even a space character can represent black. (The inverse would
                be true for an environment with a white background and black text) 
                <br> If you can't make out the image, try to squint your eyes a bit or zoom out 
                slightly. It should resemble a bald man with a beard.
            </div>
        </p>

        <h3> Technology Overview </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Python language
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                <b>os</b> module for selecting image files
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                <b>cv2</b> module for accessing camera and editing image
            </li>
    <br>    
            <li>
                Most likely based on terminal
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Feature List </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Performs operations on the image to make it easier to translate into ASCII.
                This would include changing the image to a lower resolution, making it black
                and white, and likely other steps that are undertermined at this time.
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                "Zones" of the image are assigned a value based on the average
                brightness of the pixels in each zone.
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                Each ASCII character in a predermined set is assigned to a range of brightness 
                values. The correct character is displayed in each zone based on the corresponding
                average brightness value of that zone.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Future Feature List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Toggle that lets the user tell the program whether their terminal background is 
                light or dark, then uses that information to make the image more legible by 
                inverting the order of either the ASCII character list or their brightness
                assignments.
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                Instead of just a single frame/image turned into one drawing, process live video
                feed from the webcam. Zones and ASCII characters are updated at a consistent
                framerate until the user terminates the program.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Basic Technical Features </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Python and external Python libraries
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                Source code hosted on GitHub
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                I might attempt to turn this into an Azure web app. Would be implemented 
                through <a href="https://pythonistaplanet.com/pyscript/">Pyscript.</a>
                It might work or it might not, but either way I do want to continue using Python 
                and not Javascript because I am much more familiar with the former.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Advanced Technical Features </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If there is any difficulty with formatting the text I might have to use a method
                other than command line
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>
                The use of the cv2 / OpenCV module
            </li>
        </ul>
