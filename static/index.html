        <h2>Introduction
            <img class="self-img" src="assets/self.jpg" alt="picture of me" width="400" height="400">
        </h2>

        <p>
            I am a freshman commuter here at Lewis; I am majoring in computer science but I have not
            declared a specialization or minor as of yet. I'm very interested in technology - 
            particularly software development - and I aim to do it as a career in the future. I 
            grew up in Plainfield, Illinois (I live only about 15 minutes from campus) but my parents 
            immigrated here from Poland. They both lived there up until their teen years where 
            they moved seperately with their familes and met at an American college. I have a 
            younger sister starting highschool and also persuing a career in technology, 
            presumably due to my influence. We haven't owned very many pets over the years but we
            currently have a cat that is around 6 years old.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Artificial Intelligence. While i understand we won't go exceptionally deep into
                detail on the topic, I noticed that discussion four includes it in addition to
                machine learning and data science. I don't have much knowledge on AI other than
                what i have been exposed to through science fiction, but I still think it will be
                interesting.</li>

            <li>
                Javascript. I have some Python experience but have not tried coding in JS before.</li>
            
            <li>
                Object-oriented programming. There is a dedicated class in the CS curriculum (I 
                think it's required, actually) and I don't know if we will touch on it in this 
                class, but a refresher on OOP would be useful for me. I haven't grasped it 
                completely yet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>

        <p> Although I have not recently been practicing with any instruments, I love music. 
            I collect physical media (CDs, vinyl records, cassettes) and merchandise 
            from my favorite artists. I dont exactly have top-of-the-line equipment becuase 
            audio tech gets insanely expensive really quickly, but I have a speaker and reciever 
            setup that sounds good enough for me. Some other things I could include are 
            video games, reading, skateboarding, and most recently I have been getting 
            into photography a lot. </p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>
            In my desk setup at home I use a custom-built keyboard that I made from individually
            ordered components (frame, PCB, keycaps, switches, ect.) Researching and putting it 
            together was an interesting process that resulted in me learning quite a bit about how 
            the hardware I use actually functions at the physcial level.
