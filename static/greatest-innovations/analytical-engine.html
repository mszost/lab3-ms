            In 1837 Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine as a successor to the 1822
            Difference Engine. It was the first design for a turing-complete general purpose 
            computer, possessing a memory and being capable of loops among other things. 
            Unfortunately Neither machine was fully completed during Babbage's lifetime due to 
            tecnological barriers and lack of funding.
